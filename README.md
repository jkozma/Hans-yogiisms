# Hans-yogiisms
HTML/CSS/JavaScript page of mangled sayings by Yogi Berra  

This page is intended as practice with github for students learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I don't have much experience with github myself, but I did learn a little from the Hello World project at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.  

I have a few ideas for modifications of this page that I will merge with the master branch as I implement them, and I eventually intend to add the page to a website I maintain. If anyone has ideas for improvements, I will happily entertain your pull requests.
